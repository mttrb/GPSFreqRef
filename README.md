## Modified version of the PIC code for the Silicon Chip GPS Frequency Reference to use a tu00-D200/D205 GPS module


This is a modified version of the PIC code for the Silicon Chip GPS Frequency Reference. The code has been modified to use a tu00-D200/D205 GPS module instead of the Garmin GPS15 used in the original project.

Local time is hardcoded to UTC+8 for Perth.  Fortunately, Perth doesn't have daylight saving so this works out quite nicely.

**Note:** My modified version is based on an earlier version of the code found on the Silicon Chip website.
